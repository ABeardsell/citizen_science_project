I looked at your T. magnivelare and did a little more research. Initially I was under the impression that it smelled and tasted like almonds. But now I'm convinced that this is not the case. Which leaves me quite confused about this. I'm pretty sure its a Tricholoma but Hebeloma radicosum looks like it might be an option as well. It was growing out of the root of a Red Pine too which leans more towards T. magnivelare.

I looked at your T. magnivelare and did a little more research. Initially I was under the impression that it smelled and tasted like almonds. But now I'm convinced that this is not the case. Which leaves me quite confused about this. I'm pretty sure its a Tricholoma but Hebeloma radicosum looks like it might be an option as well. It was growing out of the root of a Red Pine too which leans more towards T. magnivelare.
